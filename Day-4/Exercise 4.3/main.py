## Treasure Map

You are going to write a program which will mark a spot with an X.

In the starting code, you will find a variable called map.

This map contains a nested list.
When map is printed this is what the nested list looks like:

['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️'],['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️'],['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']

In the starting code, we have used new lines (```\n```) to format the three rows into a square, like this:

['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']
['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']
['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']

This is to try and simulate the coordinates on a real map. 


Your job is to write a program that allows you to mark a square on the map using a two-digit system. The first digit is the vertical column number and the second digit is the horizontal row number. e.g.:

First your program must take the user input and convert it to a usable format. 

Next, you need to use it to update your nested list with an "x". 

# Example Input 1

column 2, row 3 would be entered as:

23


# Example Output 1


['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']

['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']

['⬜️', 'X', '⬜️']


# Example Input 2

column 3, row 1 would be entered as:


31

# Example Output 2


['⬜️', '⬜️', 'X']

['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']

['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']


e.g. When you hit **run**, this is what should happen: 

# Hint

1. Remember that Lists start at index 0!
2. map is just a variable that contains a nested list. It's not related to the map function in Python.

row = int(position[1])

map[row-1][column-1] = 'X'
